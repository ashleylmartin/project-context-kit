# Memory Conventions

## Key Principle

> If it can be derived from AGENTS.md, CONTEXT.md, docs/KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md, or
> the codebase itself, it does NOT belong in memory. Memory stores only
> ephemeral state — what session we are on, what is active, and what gotchas
> are not obvious from reading the code.

## Structure

- `.snowflake/cortex/memory/project-context-kit.md` (max 80 lines / 6 KB) —
  the ONLY memory file.

## Rules

1. One file. Budget above. If it grows, you are storing too much.
2. Ownership of everything else: see `docs/KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md` or the
   canonical docs list in `config.json`.
3. Memory owns: session state, active work, non-obvious in-flight gotchas.
4. History lives in git log. Do not maintain a changelog file here.
5. Run `/wrap-up` (from the `project-context-kit` plugin) at session end
   to keep this file current and committed.

## Cross-Machine Sync

Clone the repo. `wrap-up` commits and pushes this file every session end.
On a fresh machine, `session-start` reads it to bootstrap local context.

## A note on the local runtime cache

`session-start` mirrors this file into a per-machine cache at
`$HOME/.snowflake/cortex/project-context-kit/cache/<sanitized-repo-path>.md`
— a path exclusive to `project-context-kit`, separate from anything the
built-in Cortex Code memory tool manages. **Don't hand-author that cache
path directly.** It gets silently overwritten by the next `session-start`,
and anything written there instead of here will eventually be lost or
conflict with this file. Always write project state to *this* file
(`.snowflake/cortex/memory/project-context-kit.md`), run `doctor` if you
suspect the two have already diverged.
